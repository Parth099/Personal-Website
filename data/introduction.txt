Hi, I'm Parth.
I'm a full-time Software Engineer at JPMorgan Chase, where I focus on enabling and securing cloud infrastructure.

I graduated in December 2023 with a B.S. in Mathematics and Computer Science, and I’m passionate about:

- Web Development
- Cloud Computing & Networking
- DevOps

At Chase, I help prepare our Azure cloud environment for enterprise-wide use. My work involves configuring guardrails to ensure developer compliance with firm-wide policies, building systems for logging and authentication/authorization (AuthN/AuthZ), and supporting secure cloud access. Currently, I’m part of the networking team, where we focus on private connectivity and provisioning network components in customer cloud accounts.
