Hi, my name is Parth
I am a full time engineer at JP Morgan & Chase
I graduated in December 2023 with a BS in Math & Computer Science

I am interested in:
    - Web Development
    - Cloud Computing
    - DevOps

At Chase, my work consists of preparing our Azure Cloud environment for general use. 
This means configuring guardrails for keeping developers compliant with the Firms's policies as well as developing systems for logging and Authn/Authz.
